README

This directory documents the evolution and design of the re-engineered (4.0)
java-gnome bindings.

About this directory
--------------------

These files are all text files, _lightly_ marked up with the syntax of
Daring Fireball's "Markdown" so that they present better as web pages. See the
top level HACKING file for further details.

This documentation are distributed with java-gnome and are maintained alongside
the source code. As such they are living documents and will likely evolve over
time as new design decisions are taken. If you care to see the history behind
certain decisions, check the mailing list archives and the version history of
the files in this directory.

If there is a change you would like to make, check out a copy of the source
code and send a patch using FIXME

Remember, if you want to hack on java-gnome itself, extend it or use it for
new and miraculous things, you're best off doing so alongside the community.
Certainly join our mailing lists, but most of all hang with us online, at
`#java-gnome` on `irc.gimp.org`


Directory name
--------------

Incidentally, this directorly was named at foss.in by a bunch of students
gathered around after Andrew Cowie gave a talk about the java-gnome 4.0
prototype; when asked what they thought a directory containing all the
background, instructions, architecture, and other answers to anything you'd
want to know should be called, Srichand Pendyala replied:

> "Why don't you call it 42?"

Which is brilliant! Alas, "42" is a bit of an inside joke, and given our goal
of approachability for newcomers, `doc/42/` wouldn't really be obvious as the
location of the design documentation.

So `doc/design/` it is, but such enthusiasm is to be rewarded, and I promised
him that his idea would live on in our documentation. Cheers Srichand!
