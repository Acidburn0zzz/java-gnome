/**
 * An image as stored in the X server's memory.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is easily confused with {@link Pixbuf}, which is what you are
 * probably looking for. Pixbuf is used for representing images on the client
 * side in your application. Loading images and passing them for use in
 * Widgets such as Image and MenuItem is done there. Pixmap, on the other
 * hand, is a wrapper around a resource in the X server.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You should not generally need to use this class. When we do draw Widgets
 * with Cairo, we do so directly to a Window in the X server which it then
 * manages for getting on screen. If you really are looking to work directly
 * with a Pixmap, then see also {@link org.freedesktop.cairo.XlibSurface
 * XlibSurface}, which ultimately is how we get data into Drawables, though
 * there too we don't work with them directly but rather let Cairo and GDK do
 * the heavy lifting.
