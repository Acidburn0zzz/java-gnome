<code>libglade</code> is a library which reads user interface descriptions as
generated by a program like <code>Glade</code> and at runtime creates live
Windows and Widgets. This is used extensively by GNOME programs; using a UI
designer takes out much of the tedium of creating Labels, allowing you to
rapidly prototype and maintain Windows and to get on with the more interesting
task of programming the application logic underlying the more dynamic aspects
of that Window.
