/**
 * This class is a hyper-thin wrapping of <code>libglade</code>, a library
 * that allows you to transform the XML interface definition files generated
 * by the GNOME User Interface Designers (of which <code>Glade</code> is the
 * original and best known) into live Widgets in your application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Using <code>libglade</code> is pretty easy. You prepare your user interface
 * in <code>Glade</code>, write some code to load it in, and then extract the
 * particular Widgets that you care about further manipulating.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since we're stuck with the somewhat stupid name that the underlying library
 * used for the tree of instantiated widgets, we recommend you use a variable
 * name like <code>glade</code> or <code>processedTree</code> for the
 * {@link XML XML} object you get back, perhaps as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * final XML glade;
 * final Window top;
 * final Button confirm;
 * 
 * glade = Glade.parse(&quot;HelpWindow.glade&quot;, &quot;window1&quot;);
 * 
 * top = (Window) glade.getWidget(&quot;window1&quot;);
 * confirm = (Button) glade.getWidget(&quot;button4&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If you're wonder where <code>"window1"</code> and <code>"button4"</code>
 * came from, they are the style of names that the <code>Glade</code> designer
 * generates for its Widgets by default. <b>To improve maintainability, you
 * are highly encouraged to change these automatically generated names to ones
 * which corresponds to the variable names being used in your Java code!</b>
 * In other words, something like:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * confirm = (Button) glade.getWidget(&quot;confirmButton&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * These examples do, however, expose the two major structural weaknesses of
 * using Glade:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it is not type safe. We do our best to check you aren't asking for
 * something that you shouldn't, but you are still at the mercy of
 * <code>ClassCastException</code> (or worse a segmentation fault) if you get
 * it wrong.
 * <li>the names embedded in your <code>parse()</code> and
 * <code>getWidget()</code> calls are tightly coupled to the textual names
 * created in the <code>Glade</code> program. If you refactor your Java code,
 * sooner or later you will forget to change the corresponding names in the
 * <code>.glade</code> files, which will inevitably lead to confusion down the
 * road.
 * </ul>
 * All that said, <code>libglade</code> provides a rapid application
 * development capability par excellence, and is a significant part of almost
 * every GNOME application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> <i>There has been considerable discussion within GNOME
 * about the state of <code>libglade</code> and it is widely expected that it
 * will be replaced by <code>GtkBuilder</code> within GTK in the very near
 * future. If that occurs before java-gnome 4.2 we will not release Glade to
 * stable. Indeed, that event may well be the trigger to bump to 4.1</i>

     * @param filename
     *            the path to the file containing the XML data generated by a
     *            <code>Glade</code> user interface designer. The path is
     *            relative to FIXME. A particularly effective Java solution is
     *            to put the <code>.glade</code> file on your
     *            <code>CLASSPATH</code> and then load the data as an
     *            InputStream with ClassLoader's
     *            {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getResourceAsStream(String)
     *            getResourceAsStream()}, passing the InputStream to the other
     *            form of parse().
     * @param root
     *            the name of the Widget whose hierarchy you wish to load. It
     *            turns out you can have several Windows and Dialogs in a
     *            single <code>.glade</code> file; because of this you
     *            normally specify which Window you want to load. Hopefully
     *            you renamed it from <code>window1</code> to something more
     *            sensible. You can also specify something lower down such as
     *            a ToolBar or VBox if that is all you need to instantiate. If
     *            you specify <code>null</code> all Widget hierarchies within
     *            the file will be loaded.
     * @throws FileNotFoundException
     *             if the specified <code>.glade</code> file cannot be found
     *             or read. Unfortunately, this actually happens quite a lot
     *             due to people assuming that the XML data will be loaded
     *             from the location of the the source file which calls this
     *             method instead of relative to the FIXME place the program
     *             is executed from. The problem can certainly be solved using
     *             an absolute path for filename, but that isn't going to be
     *             portable at all.
