 * <i><b>This is the wrapper around <code>GtkObject</code>!</b></i>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Since the GObject type system was abstracted out from GTK some time
 * after GTK was first written, <code>GtkObject</code> predates
 * <code>GObject</code>; almost all of the functionality originally resident
 * in <code>GtkObject</code> was moved to <code>GObject</code> long ago. Its
 * presence in the type hierarchy is largely for backwards compatibility. Only
 * people hacking on java-gnome itself will have any need to interact with
 * this class, and then only rarely.</i>
