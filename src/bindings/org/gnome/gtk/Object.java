 * <i>Since the GObject type system was abstracted out from GTK some time
 * after GTK was first written, <code>GtkObject</code> predates
 * <code>GObject</code>; almost all of the functionality originally resident
 * in <code>GtkObject</code> was moved to <code>GObject</code> long ago. Its
 * presence in the type hierarchy is largely for backwards compatibility. Only
 * people hacking on java-gnome itself will have any need to interact with
 * this class, and then only rarely.</i>

     * <i>We didn't expose this for a long time in java-gnome; after all,
     * memory management of both Java references and GObject Ref counts is
     * handled automatically by the diabolical cunning of this most excellent
     * library. It turns out, however, that this does not <code>free()</code>
     * the GtkObject's memory; it really only does what it says: ask other
     * GtkObjects to drop whatever Refs they may be holding to this object.
     * Thus if this GtkWidget is in a GtkContainer and you call</i>
     * <code>destroy()</code> <i>the GtkContainer will drop its Refs to this
     * GtkWidget thereby breaking its parent-child relationship.</i>

     * ie, the Java side Proxy Object goes out of scope. Nevertheless calling
     * this will speed up release of resources associated with a Widget, so
     * it's a good idea. Once you've done so,</i> <code>finalize()</code>
