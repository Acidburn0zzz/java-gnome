/**
 * An Entry which also offers a range of pre-configured options to choose
 * from. <img src="TextComboBoxEntry.png" class="snapshot" /> It is a
 * composite Widget with an Entry wrapped in a mechanism to activate a popup
 * dialog allowing the user to pick from a list of options.
 * 
 * <p>
 * ComboBoxEntry is powered by the same mechanism as the parent class
 * ComboBox; the option list is driven by a TreeModel. When constructing a
 * ComboBoxEntry, you specify the column from the model that will supply the
 * data to be used as the list of options.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Almost everyone dealing with ComboBoxEntries wonders how to get the text
 * showing in the Widget. You do this by very simply getting by getting it
 * from the Entry. Call {@link Bin#getChild() getChild()} and call that
 * Entry's {@link Entry#getText() getText()}; given:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ComboBoxEntry combo;
 * Entry e;
 * String str;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * you simply write:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * e = (Entry) combo.getChild();
 * str = e.getText();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and then do something with the returned String.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Like <code>GtkComboBox</code>, <code>GtkComboBoxEntry</code> has a
 * second text-only API that is lumped into the same classes while not being
 * able to be used together. We have similarly spliced this functionality out
 * of this class into our subclass</i> {@link TextComboBoxEntry}.
