/**
 * A ComboBoxEntry with a simplified API for displaying and extracting
 * Strings. <img src="TextComboBoxEntry.png" class="snapshot" /> When dealing
 * with ComboBoxEntries you usually get the Entry child Widget and hook up to
 * its methods and signals. Our text-only variant, however, has methods
 * allowing you to quickly manipulate the list of options and to get the
 * currently selected one.
 * 
 * <p>
 * As with the parent ComboBoxEntry, if you want what is actually <i>in</i>
 * the Entry, you will have to pull the Entry out to ask it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i> These are indeed the same convenience methods as found in the text-only
 * API of <code>GtkComboBox</code>, which we have split into
 * <code>ComboBox</code> and <code>TextComboBox</code>.
