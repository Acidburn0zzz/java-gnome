/**
 * Facilities for ensuring that only one unique instance of an application is
 * running.
 * 
 * <h2>If you're not the first, go away</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The basic algorithm is to create an Application instance with the unique
 * name corresponding to your prgram, and then check to see if there is
 * another already running. If so, then there is no need for this instance and
 * it should terminate.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * app = new Application(&quot;com.example.Program&quot;, null);
 * 
 * if (app.isRunning()) {
 *     System.exit(1);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Sending commands</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is a message-passing facility built into LibUnique which allows you
 * to send basic commands to the other running instance before you terminate
 * this one.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * app.sendMessage(Command.ACTIVATE, null);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind that this is not really meant as a generic all-powerful
 * <i>n</i> to <i>m</i> interprocess communication mechanism. In fact, the
 * entire LibUnique library is mostly about ensuring you only have one master
 * copy of an application running. But once you've established that, the
 * messaging subsystem can be used to convey simple requests to of that unique
 * instance.
