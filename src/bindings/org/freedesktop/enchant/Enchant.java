/**
 * Get a handle to an Enchant dictionary for spell checking.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Enchant is not itself a spell checking library; it is, rather a facade to
 * various common spelling mechanisms. It provides a simple and sufficient API
 * for doing spelling operations. Which actual back-end provider will be
 * employed depends on the system and user "ordering" files.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Enchant is straight-forward to use. For possibly misspelled
 * <code>word</code>, you can do
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Enchant.init();
 * 
 * dict = Enchant.requestDictionary(&quot;en_CA&quot;);
 * 
 * if (dict.check(word)) {
 *     return &quot;Spelled correctly!&quot;;
 * } else {
 *     possibles = dict.suggest(word);
 *     
 *     str.append(&quot;The word &quot;);
 *     str.append(word);
 *     str.append(&quot; was misspelled. You could correct it with one of:\n&quot;
 *     
 *     for (i = 0; i &lt; possibles.length; i++) {
 *         str.append(possibles[i]);
 *         str.append('\n');
 *     }
 *     
 *     return str.toString();
 * }
 * </pre>
