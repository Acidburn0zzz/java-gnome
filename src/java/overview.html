This is the java-gnome language bindings project!
The libraries here are as follows:

<dl>

<dt><a href="org/gnome/gtk/package-summary.html">GTK</a>
<dd><p>GTK, the widget toolkit that us used to create amazing desktop
applications for the GNOME desktop and other platforms that support it. GTK
was originally created as the <b><u>G</u></b>IMP's widget <b><u>T</u></b>ool
<b><u>K</u></b>it), and has since become the backbone of the entire GNOME
project.</p>

<dt><a href="org/gnome/gdk/package-summary.html">GDK</a>
<dd><p>GDK contains the low level <b><u>D</u></b>rawing primitives (elements
on the screen like points, images, cursors, etc) along with facilities for
handling events coming back from the user (such as mouse clicks and
keystrokes). It has implementations of various backends allowing GTK to be
used on a number of different platforms.</p>

<dt><a href="org/gnome/glib/package-summary.html">GLib and GObject</a>
<dd><p>GLib and GObject are the base libraries in GNOME, providing general
purpose utilities and an extensible object-oriented type system. These are
largely transparent to the Java developer, but nevertheless the infrastructure
needed to support the other libraries resides here.</p>

<dt>Pango
<dd><p>Pango, the text layout and rending engine used to power font rendering
and internationalization in GNOME.</p>

<dt>ATK
<dd><p>ATK, the <b><u>A</u></b>ccessibility toolkit that enables GNOME to be
used by people needing extra support to make the most of their computers.  ATK
is used by tools such as screen readers, magnifiers, and input devices to
permit a rich interaction with the desktop through alternative means. It is
also, amazingly enough, used by testing frameworks to introspect widgets and
text on the screen.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h3>

<!-- Tutorials -->

<p>The first call you will make in any java-gnome program is going to be
{@link org.gnome.gtk.Gtk#init(java.lang.String[]) Gtk.init()}, so you might
try starting there.</p>
