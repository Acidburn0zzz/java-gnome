Although java-gnome 4.0 is a complete from-the-ground-up rewrite, certain
parts would not have been possible without the example and inspiration
provided by the generations of authors and maintainers of java-gnome leading
up to 2006. We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude.

Where significant portions of code is re-used, the copyright and authorship
noted in a given file reflect it. Otherwise the authors of java-gnome, and the
copyright they exert as owners of their work, are summarized above and listed
on a file by file basis.
